# 2D platformer game demo

Using the simple game engine from my previous project to make a short 2d platformer demo.

Mainly wanted to learn how 2D collisions work and implement that. [Collision Detection for Dummies](https://katyscode.wordpress.com/2013/01/18/2d-platform-games-collision-detection-for-dummies/comment-page-1/#comment-33272) helped a lot.

The Code Quality... is not so great. Especially the commits towards the end. Started out with big plans, but in the end lost a lot of steam and just wanted to finish this.

## Build instructions for Linux.

Make sure SDL2, SDL2_image, and SDL2_TTF libraries are installed.

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./game
```
## Build instructions for Windows.
Use CMake, it should work.
